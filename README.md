to do:
    remove none asci char? remove weird characters? or convert to normal? 
    make sure retrieiving urls from parent is factored into progress bar
    make app replayable, currently crashes on second press of start
    assign all attributes in the init method! change scrape and load urls methods??
    didn't strip whitespace from urls in manual merge, also crashed
    add 'files created here' label to finished scroll bar
    could threading speed up some things? use that program to figure out why tkinter is so slow to boot.
    speed up gui loading time? or add a nice message as it does?
    check file browsing button
    check from artist/playlist functions
    make pretty and make variable names shorter
    create readme and liscence
    upload to pypi?
    finish unit testing with pytest
    rename app?
