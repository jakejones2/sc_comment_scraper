to do:
    the 'tracks' parent url crashes, but playlist works fine
    remove none asci char? remove weird characters? or convert to normal? 
    assign all attributes in the init method! 
    could threading speed up some things? use that program to figure out why tkinter is so slow to boot.
    speed up gui loading time? or add a nice message as it does?
    make pretty and make variable names shorter
    create readme
    upload to pypi?
    finish unit testing with pytest
    rename app?
